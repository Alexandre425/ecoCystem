Random thoughts
- Grass growth rate influenced by soil fertility, max height influenced by temperature?
- Max plant height based off root size/thickness, trunk thickness, woodyness
- Plants that are less edible grow slower (more woody, more resilient leaves)
- Less edible plants require herbivores with an iron gut (which have less efficient digestion)
- Latitute + noise based temperature
- Needle-like, less efficient leaves for cold resistant plants (e.g. pine trees)
- Temperature-based energy consumption for animals
- Fur trait to reduce endothermic energy requirement, should have significant disadvantages in hot areas, possibly lethal
    - Internal temperature simulation? With behavior that seeks appropriate ambient temperature 
- Stealth and perception
    - Possibly temperature-aligned, creatures with good desert stealth have bad tundra stealth, etc.
    - Grass height (grazing system) influences perception and stealth
    - Tall creatures can look over tall grass, small creatures can hide in the grass
    - Behavior to exploit tall grass stealth (ambush predation)
        - If grass size > 0.5 * animal size, it can be used for active hiding (no movement)
- (Hierarchichal?) State machine animal AI
    - Traits influence weights and thresholds when transitioning from behaviors
- Noise-based water depth and average precipitation
    - Wider roots take advantage of precipitation better
    - Deeper roots take advantage of deep water reserves
