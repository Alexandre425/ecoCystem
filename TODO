Random thoughts
 - Max plant height based off root size/thickness, trunk thickness, woodyness
 - Plants that are less edible grow slower (more woody, more resilient leaves)
 - Less edible plants require herbivores with an iron gut (which have less efficient digestion)
 - Latitute + noise based temperature
 - Needle-like, less efficient leaves for cold resistant plants (e.g. pine trees)
 - Temperature-based energy consumption for animals
 - Fur trait to reduce endothermic energy requirement, should have significant disadvantages in hot areas, possibly lethal
   - Internal temperature simulation? With behavior that seeks appropriate ambient temperature
